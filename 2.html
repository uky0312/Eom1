<H2>Love yourself</h2>
  <p><img src="love.jfif" width="600"></p>
  <p>For all the times that you rain on my parade
  And all the clubs you get in using my name
  You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
  You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
</P><P>
  And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
  I don't but, you still hit my phone up
  And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
  I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
  My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
  And I never like to admit that I was wrong
  And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
  And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
</P><P>
  Cause if you like the way you look that much
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
  You should go and love yourself
</P><P>
  But when you told me that you hated my friends
  The only problem was with you and not them
  And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
  And tried to make me forget where I came from
</P><P>
  And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
  I don't but, you still hit my phone up
  And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
  I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
  My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
  And I never like to admit that I was wrong
  And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
  And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
</P><P>
  Cause if you like the way you look that much
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
  You should go and love yourself
</P><P>
  For all the times that you've made me feel small
  I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
  Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
  Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
</P><P>
  Cause if you like the way you look that much
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
  You should go and love yourself
  Cause if you like the way you look that much
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
  You should go and love yourself
